 Raspberry Jam is a monthly event for people who want to learn a bit more about the Raspberry Pi and coding in general.

 * [Minecraft Pi Edition](http://pi.minecraft.net)
 * ScratchGPIO with [LEDBorgs](https://www.piborg.org/ledborg)
 * Introduction to [Python](https://www.python.org)
 * Basic circuits with breadboards
  
The topics we may to cover over the next few months

* Using Python with GPIO
* [Sonic Pi](http://sonic-pi.net)
* Raspberry Pi camera module
* Plugging stuff into the [GPIO](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/usage/gpio/) pins

#FAQs

## What kind of learning resources are available

Most of the resources that are used in the jams are also collated on our [Resources Repository](https://github.com/NIRaspberryJam/Raspberry-Jam-Resources) and are available for use both at and beyond the regular jam events

## Is there an age limit to enter the event?

Raspberry Jam is not specifically aimed at any age range, but any child younger than 14 must be accompanied by a parent or guardian

## What are my transport/parking options getting to the event?

We're 5 minutes walk from Europa Bus Centre, and Parking is available all across the Weavers Court Campus

## Is there a charge for the event

Farset Labs' members operate the Raspberry Jam for free for all attendees, but donations to cover operating costs are greatly appreciated.

## What should I bring to the event?

We don't have the resources available to provide everyone with a machine, so if you can help us out by bringing your own device, be it laptop/tablet/smartphone, that'd be great.

## What Child Protection Policies are in place?

Only those registered may attend, including mentors. For full details, see [Farset Labs' Child Protection Policy](/about/child_protection.html). At the lead mentors' discretion, the event space may be sealed off from the rest of the space.

##I can't make it, what can I do to help?

If you just want to support our event here at Farset Labs, please consider making a donation to the charity and mention in your donation that you wish it to go to fund refreshments, resources, materials, and equipment for the Jams.
